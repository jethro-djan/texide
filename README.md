## About this project

This project is a proof-of-concept of a drop-in replacement for ConTeXt compilers written in pure Rust

## Why?

We have come a long way in our understanding of document processing since the time of Donald Knuth. It is our aim to create a library that can be leveraged upon and built on by applications. The author also personally thinks the syntax of ConTeXt is better than LaTeX, and this library will help popularize it.
